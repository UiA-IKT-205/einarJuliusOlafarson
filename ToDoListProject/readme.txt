Todo super is a todolist app created over the course of the three weeks given to us for the project. 
It was designed to fit the visual specification given in the project as much as possible with some minor changes.
Primarily the app currently allows you to add unique lists with unique todos.
The app fetches the current database on startup and afterwards syncs all changes you make regardless of the change.
The current drawback to this app is that due to most of the creation of it being a learning process there was not as much
effort or consideration taken into the database structure and as such all lists and todos must be unique within those lists.
In the future if I were to make this again I would take more consideration into how to preserve non unique items
and be able to update and delete them accordingly.
